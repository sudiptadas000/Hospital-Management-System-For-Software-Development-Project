# Hospital-Management-System-For-Software-Development-Project

This is a C programming code for a Simple Hospital Management System. It allows the user to add, view, search, edit, and delete patient information in a hospital.

The code uses a struct to store patient information, including the patient's name, disease, age, cabin number, and phone number.

When the program runs, it displays a menu of options to the user, and the user can select an option by entering a number. Depending on the option selected, the program performs different actions such as adding new patient information, displaying all patient information, searching for a specific patient by name or other attributes, editing patient information, or deleting patient information.

The program also includes a pattern-making code at the beginning that prints a series of stars in a specific pattern
